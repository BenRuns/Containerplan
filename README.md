Containerplan
=============

Container Load plan code

The goal of this program is to create a program that will eventually be able to analyze freight and output a 
plan on how to load it. It's for people new to shipping and for the experienced. 

My focus is on intermodel ocean containers but I am trying to consider plans for domestic shipping. I'm open to suggestions but I will be working on this piece by piece.

Currently have a simple cubic measure calculator running on google app engine. patterson-ben.appspot.com/container
